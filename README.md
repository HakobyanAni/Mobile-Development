# MVVM pattern

<b>The Model View ViewModel (MVVM)</b> is an architectural pattern used in software engineering that originated from Microsoft which is specialized in the Presentation Model design pattern. It is based on the Model-view-controller pattern (MVC), and is targeted at modern UI development platforms (WPF and Silverlight) in which there is a UX developer who has different requirements than a more "traditional" developer. MVVM is a way of creating client applications that leverages core features of the WPF platform, allows for simple unit testing of application functionality, and helps developers and designers work together with less technical difficulties.
